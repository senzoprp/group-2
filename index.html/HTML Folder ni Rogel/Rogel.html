            Hello there! My name is.. yeah it's written on the sides. 
            <br> I am currently a freshman of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science </br>
            at Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology. </br>
            I've been in this world for 18 years and counting.
            And I give <br> you my warmest welcome
            for clicking and delving into my portfolio!</br>

        <h3 id="Final_Hard">
            Yes, I am always hard... working. Because I always push
            <br> myself to my limits and I am persistent when it comes to </br>
            learning brand new stuff

            <i> I was born in Marikina, specifically in a lying-in clinic. The day <br> 
            I greeted the world with my presence was on the 14th of May, <br> 
            2006. I started studying by the time I turn 5, straight to <br> 
            preparatory. During my previous year levels, I've shown <br> 
            great results, hoarded awards, and graduated elementary school as the class valedictorian. My goal is to have a successful future 
            as a CS graduate and pay back the hardships that my parents 
            have done for me. I also like to play guitar and I like fingerstyling because fingers hehe. </i>
